                    <p>
                        Our opening ceremony begins on June 25 2022 at 12:00 PM EDT. Attendance is compulsory. 
                        The link is found in our Slack, which can be accessed after completing our registration form. 
                        <br><br>
                        Hacking begins on June 25 at 1:00 PM EDT. Projects must be submitted to the Devpost judging platform by June 26 at 1:00 PM EDT. 
                        Failure to submit a project by the deadline or reasonable suspicion that work was completed before the hacking period started at the 
                        organizers' discretion will result in disqualification from earning prizes.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="py-4">Eligibility:</h5>
                    <p>
                        Any student enrolled in a higher school institution for the 2022-2023 school year is eligible to participate, subject to regulations set 
                        by the hackers' locations' authorities. Hackers who are enrolled in secondary schools may still apply by emailing us at: 
                        <a href = "mailto: team@hack3.co">team@hack3.co</a>.
                        <br><br>
                        <i>Any falsified information may serve as grounds for disqualification for earning awards.</i>
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="py-4">Submissions:</h5>
                    <p>
                        Our judges will judge 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place prizes, three 1st place prizes for each track, a best beginners project prize and sponsor prizes.
                        <br><br>
                        The judging process will be different from that of a typical online hackathon. On submission, a Hack3 organizer will check your 
                        project against eligibility. You will be assigned a Zoom link and a time from 1:30 PM EDT to 3:30 PM EDT. Wait in the waiting room with 
                        your team until your time comes. You will have 5 minutes: 3 minutes for a presentation and demo, and 2 minute for questions. 
                        <br><br>
                        Submissions can include phone apps, hardware devices, web applications, and desktop applications, among others. 
                        There is no limit, except that we expect technology to be used in some capacity. We encourage hackers to post a 
                        demonstration video or a link for judges to test the project.
                        <br><br>
                        Submissions are recommended to be linked to a Github repository where our systems can check for plagiarism. While we encourage 
                        using public code online, we will immediately disqualify any project that simply rebrands another project without changing functionality. 
                        <br><br>
                        Remember, we retain full discretion over the selection of winners. Our say is final.  
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="py-4">Submission Rights & Display:</h5>
                    <p>
                        As part of future Hack3 outreach programs, we may include hackers' public submission information found in Devpost in advertising material.
                        <br><br>
                        Further, you may voluntarily submit pictures for us to use in future promotional materials of yourself coding. 
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="py-4">Prizes & Winner Selection:</h5>
                    <p>
                        Prizes can be found on our homepage section within Devpost. Submissions will be reviewed by at least three judges. 
                        Each judge will grade projects by themself following our rubric, and the highest scoring submissions will be reviewed 
                        by at least five judges to check eligibility.
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="py-4">Additional Notes:</h5>
                    <p>
                        Our hackathon is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable environment and harassment-free 
                        experience for everyone, regardless of the following:

                        We do not tolerate harassment of hackathon participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not 
                        appropriate at any hackathon venue, this includes the following:

                        Hackathon participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon at the discretion of the hackathon organisers.
                        <br><br>
                        Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, 
                        physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion or political views, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate 
                        intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or 
                        other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
                        <br><br>
                        Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object 
                        to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a 
                        reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).
                        <br><br>
                        Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
                        <br><br>
                        As this is a hackathon, we like to explicitly note that the hacks created at our hackathon are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.
                        <br><br>
                        Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, 
                        or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create 
                        a sexualised environment.
                        <br><br>
                        If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a 
                        member of hackathon staff immediately.
                        <br><br>
                        Hackathon staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or 
                        otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the hackathon. We value your attendance.
                        <br><br>
                        If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the hackathon organisers may take any action they deem appropriate. This includes 
                        warning the offender, expulsion from the hackathon with no refund (if applicable), or reporting their behaviour to local law enforcement.
                        <br><br>
                        We expect participants to follow these rules at hackathon and workshop venues and hackathon-related social events.
